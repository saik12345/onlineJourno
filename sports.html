    <div class="news-text"><h1>India vs. West Indies Highlights, 1st ODI: India beat WI by five wickets </h1><hr>
        <p>
            The spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja shared seven wickets between them as India bundled West Indies out for 114 in the first ODI at Barbados. Debutant Mukesh Kumar, Hardik Pandya and Shardul Thakur would also nab a wicket each. Earlier, India captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and opted to field first as India began the white-ball leg of their tour of the West Indies.

Rohit Sharma mentioned, “The pitch had everything for seamers and spinners, our guys did well to restrict them to that score. We wanted to give game time to the ODI guys who have come in, we will keep trying those things whenever possible. To restrict them to 115, we knew we could try these guys and give them a go. I don't think they'll get many chances like this.” Kuldeep Yadav stated, “I'm just focusing on my rhytmn, hitting the right lengths and it has been very nice. I thought it will be a seamy paradise, we are happy we got 7 wickets from our side. It was spinning a bit, and there was bounce as well. It's always good to have competition, we just try to work together.”

If Jadeja broke the middle, Kuldeep took care of providing the finishing touches. The left-arm wrist-spinner, who appeared to have lost his way post the last 50-over World Cup, was top of Rohit’s interest ever since he took over as captain. Since the last 50-over World Cup, Jadeja averages 54.86 with the ball and has an economy rate of 5.27, which is half more than his career. In the 21 matches prior to the one in Bridgetown, he had only 15 wickets in 21 matches. After having a successful Test returns in Bangladesh and in the limited-overs at home, Kuldeep didn’t have a good IPL, where he picked up only 10 wickets.

    <div class="news-text"><h1>India pulls out of games in China over stapled visas for Arunachal athletes</h1><hr><p>As a mark of protest against China’s decision to issue stapled visas — instead of stamped ones — to three athletes from Arunachal Pradesh, India withdrew its entire wushu (martial art) team from the World University Games which begin Friday in Chengdu.

        The decision came hours after airport authorities in New Delhi stopped an eight-member contingent, comprising five athletes, a coach and two support staff, at the boarding gate minutes before departure Thursday midnight, according to coach Raghvendra Singh.</p></div>
