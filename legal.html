        <div class="news-text"><h1>Madras High Court judge asks State to consider allowing conjugal visits in prisons for inmates</h1><hr><p>Madras High Court judge, Justice SM Subramaniam has asked the Tamil Nadu government to consider permitting conjugal visits for prison inmates across the State.

            Justice Subramaniam directed the State to consider a scheme similar to what is being implemented in Punjab, where low prison inmates are allowed conjugal visits for fixed hours, once every two months.
            
            Conjugal visits in the context of prisons refer to the concept of permitting an inmate to spend time in privacy with his or her spouse, within the prison premises, thus allowing for physical intimacy and procreation.
            
            While some courts, including the Madras High Court have in the past, granted parole to inmates on the grounds of conjugal rights, in September 2022, the State of Punjab implemented a system of allowing an inmate conjugal visits within the prison premises.
            
            The guidelines issued by the Punjab government though, clarify that conjugal visits cannot be claimed as a right. The State allows visits by spouses for two hours once every two months and the visiting spouse is required to furnish a valid ID, proof of marriage and a medical certificate declaring that he or she does not have HIV or any other sexually transmitted disease.</p></div>

        <div class="news-text"><h1>Calcutta High Court upholds law allowing State to recommend transfer of school teachers</h1><hr><p>The Calcutta High Court Thursday upheld the constitutional validity of the West Bengal School Service Commission Act of 1997 (WBSSC Act) which empowers the State government to instruct the School Service Commission (SSC) to transfer a teacher from one aided school to another [Rabin Tudu vs State of West Bengal].

            A division bench of Justices Harish Tandon and Prasenjit Biswas refused to accept the argument that such transfers would infringe the right to life of the teachers.
            
            "In the perspective of the service in a public employment, the transfer is an incident of service and if the transfer is made in accordance with the procedure established by law, we do not find any justification that it infringes the fundamental right to life. Every service in the public employment unless forbidden by law is transferable. A teacher which is placed in a school if transferred to another school, it does not affect the right to life as he or she is conscious that the service is transferable," the Court held in its order.
            
            In every transferable service, if a person is transferred from one place to another he may contend that his dignity is impaired and that he is entitled to live a life in stress-free atmosphere.
            
            This would result in a situation where none of the employee in the public employment can be transferred from one place to another, the bench opined.</p></div>
