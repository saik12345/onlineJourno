        <div class="news-text"><h1>Supreme Court issues notice on RBI appeal against Kerala HC order that lifted loan restrictions imposed on co-operative bank</h1><hr>
            <p>The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to in an appeal filed by the Reserve Bank of India, against an order of the Kerala High Court that lifted the loan restrictions imposed by it on Thiruvalla East Co-Operative Bank Ltd. The notice was issued by a division bench of Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia. Attorney General for India R Venkataramani appeared for the RBI. A division bench of the Kerala High Court had affirmed the order of a single bench that lifted the restriction placed on the co-operative Bank by RBI to stop further sanction/disbursal of loans and advance the bank was not given an opportunity of hearing.

RBI had conducted an inspection before issuing a prohibitory order to the co-operative Bank, along with an inspection report. According to the report, there were some deficiencies in banking practice, including some loan advance schemes that were susceptible to foul play.

Referring to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Kerala High Court had held that the RBI cannot completely prohibit the transactions of the bank under Sections 35 and 36 unless there were exceptional circumstances to do so. SC stated, "We are of the firm view that in normal circumstances, RBI cannot pass a prohibitory order under Section 36(1) without giving banking company an opportunity of being heard. The deviation is exceptional and that too, to protect public interest. If RBI intends to pass such an order, it must demonstrate with reasons in the order itself how the larger public interest would adversely be affected if prohibition order is not imposed.”

The case is titled as ‘Reserve Bank of India V. Thiruvalla East Co-Operative Bank Ltd, Special Leave to Appeal (C) No(s). 15667/2023’.

        <div class="news-text"><h1>Calcutta High Court upholds law allowing State to recommend transfer of school teachers</h1><hr><p>The Calcutta High Court Thursday upheld the constitutional validity of the West Bengal School Service Commission Act of 1997 (WBSSC Act) which empowers the State government to instruct the School Service Commission (SSC) to transfer a teacher from one aided school to another [Rabin Tudu vs State of West Bengal].

            A division bench of Justices Harish Tandon and Prasenjit Biswas refused to accept the argument that such transfers would infringe the right to life of the teachers.
            
            "In the perspective of the service in a public employment, the transfer is an incident of service and if the transfer is made in accordance with the procedure established by law, we do not find any justification that it infringes the fundamental right to life. Every service in the public employment unless forbidden by law is transferable. A teacher which is placed in a school if transferred to another school, it does not affect the right to life as he or she is conscious that the service is transferable," the Court held in its order.
            
            In every transferable service, if a person is transferred from one place to another he may contend that his dignity is impaired and that he is entitled to live a life in stress-free atmosphere.
            
            This would result in a situation where none of the employee in the public employment can be transferred from one place to another, the bench opined.</p></div>
