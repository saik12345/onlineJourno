        <div class="news-text"><h1>Oppenheimer vs. Barbie box office collection” Christopher Nolan’s film makes over Rs 73 crore in a week</h1><hr><p>
            Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer released alongside Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and dominated the box office in India during its first week. After six days, the film collected Rs 67.85 crore and on the seventh day, it earned Rs 5.25 crore, as per industry tracker Sacnilk. This brings the film’s net collection in India to Rs 73.15 crore. Barbie and Oppenheimer’s dominance at the box office is primarily in the urban cities. 

Globally, Oppenheimer is trailing behind Barbie, with the former collecting $230 million and the latter making over $495 million, as per Box Office Mojo. The trade publication suggests that India is the third-largest market for Oppenheimer, having contributed over $8 million to its global total. The US is the largest market for the film where it has made over $117 million, followed by UK, where it has earned over $16 million.

Greta Gerwig's Barbie, on the other hand is way behind Oppenheimer in terms of its collection in India. Till Wednesday, July 26, Barbie earned $528 million while Oppenheimer collected $265 million. However, the film, which released on the same day as Oppenheimer, earned Rs 2 crore in India on the seventh day. 

Oppenheimer has been in some controversy in India because of a certain scene which shows two characters sharing an intimate moment while reading the Bhagavad Gita. The Indian Express previously reported that Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur was upset with the Central Board of Film Certification for clearing the scene, even though it was trimmed.

Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are seen in lead roles as Barbie and Ken. The movie follows Barbie, as she discovers the joys and perils of living in a human world. Oppenheimer focuses on J Robert Oppenheimer and his team of scientists working towards developing and designing the atomic bomb, in what was called the Manhattan Project.
