        <h1>Manipur ethnic violence: Mob chops off man's head, cops arrest 5th accused in women's video case</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The visuals of a man's head being chopped off have surfaced from the ongoing ethnic conflict in northeast India's Manipur. The latest video has surfaced barely two days after the footage of women being paraded naked before one of them was gangraped by members of a rampaging mob. 
            <br>
            The incident reportedly occurred on July 2, when the man, part of a group of volunteers keeping guard was hacked to death by a rampaging mob.
            <br>
            The man has been identified as David Theik, a resident of Lamza village in Churachandpur district and until the pandemic, was working as a waiter at a hotel in Mumbai. His father is physically disabled while his mother died when he was young. David was reportedly planning to go back to Mumbai but was stuck in the ethnic conflict that gripped the state since the beginning of May. 
            <br>
            According to a report in Hindustan Times, Theik was first shot, then his body was severed, and one of his eyes gouged out.
            <br>
            The chopped head was then placed atop a bamboo fence.</p>

    <div class="news-text"><h1>Ukraine war: Western armour struggles against Russian defences</h1>
    <hr><p>The general in charge of Ukraine's stuttering counter-offensive in the south has said Russian defences are making it difficult for military equipment, including Western tanks and armoured vehicles, to move forward.

        Gen Oleksandr Tarnavskyi says his forces are struggling to overcome multi-layered minefields and fortified defensive lines.
        
        "That is why most of the tasks have to be performed by troops."
        
        He says Russia's military has displayed "professional qualities" by preventing Ukrainian forces from "advancing quickly".
        
        "I don't underestimate the enemy," he adds.
        
        Latest unconfirmed reports from the US suggest the main thrust of the counter-offensive has begun. The Institute for the Study of War says Ukrainian forces appear to have broken through "certain pre-prepared Russian defensive positions".
        
        But so far there's little evidence that Western supplied tanks and armoured vehicles have been able to tip the balance decisively in Ukraine's favour.
        
        Several Leopard tanks and US Bradley fighting vehicles were damaged or destroyed in the first days of the offensive, near the city of Orikhiv.
        
        Ukraine's 47th Brigade, which had largely been trained and equipped by the West to try to break through Russian lines, were soon stopped in their tracks by mines and then targeted by artillery.</p></div>
