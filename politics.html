        <h1>Violence erupted: what is happening in Manipur?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Manipur is home to more than 30 ethnic rebel groups, all made up primarily of men, who were originally all fighting for homelands of their own. They can be broadly divided into three categories: Naga, Meitei and Kuki. In Manipur violence erupted at the time between the majority Meitei and the minority Kuki-Zo over job quotas and land rights. Intermittent clashes have continued since.

The unrest was triggered by a court order that the government should consider extending special benefits enjoyed by the Kuki-Zo people to the Meitei population as well. The violence erupted after the Kuki-Zo community protested against Meitei demands for reserved public job quotas and college admissions as a form of affirmative action and over long-held fears that they might also be allowed to acquire land in areas currently reserved for tribal groups.

A clip went viral recently showing two women said to be from the Kuki-Zo group walking naked along a street, being jeered and harassed by a mob reportedly from the Meitei community. The video emerged more than two months after it was filmed due to an internet ban in Manipur since May 3. 

The violence is also related to the civil war raging in neighbouring Myanmar since shortly after its February 2021 coup. Chin refugees from Myanmar have reportedly been seeking shelter in Manipur (though in fewer numbers than in the adjacent state of Mizoram). In justifying their demand for Scheduled Tribe status, the Meitei claim that “illegal immigration from Myanmar [and] Bangladesh” is threatening their position.

Radical Meitei outfits such as Arambai Tenggol and Meitei Leepun accuse the Kuki, who share an ethnic heritage with the Chin, of illegally settling refugees in Manipur’s hills (according to official figures, there are 10,000 Chin refugees in the state).

Some Kuki criminal groups are in fact running drugs, but they are just one of many players in the illicit business, who also include Meiteis and Nagas.

These allegations added to longstanding animosity between the two communities. The Meitei have long alleged that the Kuki are not indigenous to Manipur but were resettled in the state by the British from the nearby hills of Myanmar in the nineteenth century.

Trouble has been brewing since August 2015, when a former state government, also headed by a Meitei, passed three laws that tribal communities perceived as designed to favour the Meitei. The tribes saw these laws as an attempt by the Meitei to acquire the power to buy land in the hills and sow doubt about the citizenship of tribal groups.

In the ensuing demonstrations, the security forces killed nine young people belonging to the tribes in Churachandpur. As a mark of protest, the Kuki and other tribal groups refused to bury the dead, keeping them in the morgue for two years.

At least 130 people have been killed and more than 50,000 have fled their homes since the violence began. Tens of thousands have fled to government-run camps. Homes and churches in dozens of villages have been torched.

In a detailed report to the Supreme Court in June, the civil society group Manipur Tribal Forum said many gruesome acts of violence, including rape and beheadings, had not been investigated by state authorities. The main suspect in the sexual abuse case, identified as Khuirem Herodas, a Meitei, was arrested on Thursday. He was taken into custody hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke his nearly 80-day silence on the violence in Manipur by condemning the alleged sexual assault as “shameful” and promising tough action.

Local women pelted stones and burnt some parts of the house belonging to the prime accused in a village. Protests were planned in several parts of India by rights groups demanding justice and swift investigations into the latest incident to raise questions about the safety of women in India.

N. Biren Singh, Chief Minister of Manipur (BJP) tried to ascribe responsibility to Kuki militants. “The fight is between the state and central forces [and] the terrorists who are trying to break Manipur”, he said, telling the media security forces had killed 40 Kuki insurgents who were attacking Meitei civilians with sophisticated weapons. “It is not a fight between communities”, Singh asserted.

Additionally, The withdrawal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) in major parts of Manipur has created technical issues for implementing all-out army operations as in the past.

    <div class="news-text"><h1>INDIA: to deny Modi’s third straight win in Lok Sabha election</h1>
    <hr><p>
      Modi’s political opponents did exactly that as they announced a new alliance – called India alliance – to deny Modi a third straight win and defeat his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in next year’s Lok Sabha election. The acronym, which stands for Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), comprises 26 opposition parties so far. More parties could join the alliance ahead of the general elections due by May.

The INDIA is led by the Indian National Congress party which once dominated the country’s politics. The election battle is between “Narendra Modi and INDIA, his ideology and INDIA,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said at a two-day conclave of the alliance in Bengaluru on July 18. Gandhi’s 136-day march on foot across the length of the country shot India’s grand old party back into political prominence. 

Besides Congress, the other main opposition parties that form INDIA are Trinamool Congress (TMC), Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Janata Dal-United (JD-U), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), National Conference (NC), Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM), among others.

Some of these are powerful regional parties that are direct rivals to some of their own alliance partners in some states. The parties are also beset with ideological differences and personality clashes, and seem undecided on whether to cede space to other groups in regions where they hold sway.

Nearly a decade of Modi’s rule in India has been marked by a struggling economy, rising unemployment, attacks by Hindu nationalists against the country’s minorities, particularly Muslims, and a shrinking space for dissent and free media.

Rajeev Gowda of the Congress stated, “There are many issues that people are facing. The first is the failure on the economic front. No new jobs have been created. There has been a lot of polarisation, hatred and violence. All these have to be changed. That’s why we have come together.”
