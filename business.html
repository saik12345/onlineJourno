    <div class="news-text"><h1>Indian companies can directly list in GIFT IFSC, says FM Nirmala Sitharaman </h1><hr><p>To boost GIFT IFSC’s growing popularity, the government has now allowed Indian companies to directly list in the special zone even if they are not listed elsewhere on any of the exchanges in the country. 

        On Friday, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while launching the Corporate Debt Market Development Fund (CDMDF) in Mumbai, said that the government has given the final go ahead for Indian companies to directly list on exchanges in GIFT International Financial Services Centre (IFSC). “The government has taken a decision to enable direct listing of listed and unlisted companies on the IFSC exchanges. This is a major step forward and this would provide access to global capital and result in better valuation of the Indian companies,” said the finance minister. 

        “It is worth emphasising that the government’s vision for GIFT IFSC transcends much beyond the realm of traditional finance and ventures into the realm of thought leadership,” she added. </p></div>
