        <div class="news-text"><h1>Murder case against 6 Faridabad cops after man dies of custodial violence</h1><hr>
            <p>More than six policemen of NIT Faridabad cybercrime police station have been booked for murder after an alleged criminal died while in police custody, police said on Monday.
The family of victim Shaikul (30), a resident of Rajasthan's Gobindgarh district, has alleged that he died on Sunday after being beaten up by the policemen.

“On the complaint of the victim's brother, an FIR under section 302 (murder) of the IPC was registered against two named policemen and others at Faridabad Old police station on Monday,' a police spokesperson said. The accused policemen have been transferred to the police line and a magisterial probe has also been launched against them, he said.

Before Shaikul's arrest, the Faridabad Police had nabbed five people -- Shakul Khan, Narendra, Dharmendra, Sabir and Ali Mohammad -- on July 20 for allegedly duping a Faridabad resident Subrata of ₹ 1.90 lakh in the name of selling a plot, police said.

On July 13, the cyber station NIT police had registered a case regarding the incident, they said. On July 21, the police produced the accused in court and took them on remand. During the remand, on July 21 Shaikul told the police that he was feeling weak and had difficulty in breathing, the spokesperson said.

The police team took him to BK Hospital for treatment. The doctors sent him back after giving him the necessary medicines but he was taken back to the hospital the next day due to health problems. He died about two hours after being admitted to the hospital again, the spokesperson said. The family members of the deceased had refused to conduct the body's post-mortem on Sunday, however, it was done today after they agreed, police said.

Nuh Congress MLA Aftab Ahemad also reached the BK hospital to meet the victim's family and demanded a fair investigation into the case.

    <div class="news-text"><h1>Triple murder in Agra village over property dispute</h1><hr><p>In a dispute over 2.5 bighas of land, three brothers allegedly killed their father and two brothers with axes in the Garhi Kalia village in Agra district on Tuesday. The accused fled the village after committing the triple murder, while the police are trying to nab them.

        The accused brothers, identified as Jayprakash, Bhanupratap and Harveer, got into a quarrel with their father Rajendra Singh, and brothers Som Prakash and Hem Prakash during a family meeting on Tuesday. The quarrel soon took a violent turn and the three accused attacked the deceased with axes.
        
        While the two sons died on the spot, their father Rajendra Singh died at the hospital while receiving treatment.
        
        The accused also intended to kill the women in the house to claim complete rights over the property, but the women locked themselves in their houses and escaped the attack.The accused are currently absconding, while Police Commissioner Pritinder Singh said his team is on a manhunt and will soon arrest them.

        Talking about the incident, CP Singh further said, “The dispute over the distribution of land seems to be the root cause of the triple murder, but we are also probing it from other angles. It appears that the murder was pre-planned. Bhanu's wife Aarti, who saved her life by hiding in the room, informed the police about the matter. We will soon arrest the three killer brothers.”
        
        The deceased Rajendra Singh lived in Mathura with his younger son Hem Prakash, while he owned 2.5 bighas of land and a two-room house in Garhi Kalia, where his other sons were living.
        
        Rajendra Singh had divided the village land equally among all his sons. But the accused Jayaprakash, Bhanupratap, and Harveer objected to his decision.
        
        On Monday, Rajendra Singh came to the village from Mathura to talk to his sons about the land distribution. On Tuesday, at around 10 am, he arranged for a family meeting to resolve the matter. When he refused to accede to the demands of his three sons, they attacked and killed him along with his two other sons.</p></div>
