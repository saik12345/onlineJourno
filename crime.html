    <div class="news-text"><h1>Triple murder in Agra village over property dispute</h1><hr><p>In a dispute over 2.5 bighas of land, three brothers allegedly killed their father and two brothers with axes in the Garhi Kalia village in Agra district on Tuesday. The accused fled the village after committing the triple murder, while the police are trying to nab them.

        The accused brothers, identified as Jayprakash, Bhanupratap and Harveer, got into a quarrel with their father Rajendra Singh, and brothers Som Prakash and Hem Prakash during a family meeting on Tuesday. The quarrel soon took a violent turn and the three accused attacked the deceased with axes.
        
        While the two sons died on the spot, their father Rajendra Singh died at the hospital while receiving treatment.
        
        The accused also intended to kill the women in the house to claim complete rights over the property, but the women locked themselves in their houses and escaped the attack.The accused are currently absconding, while Police Commissioner Pritinder Singh said his team is on a manhunt and will soon arrest them.

        Talking about the incident, CP Singh further said, “The dispute over the distribution of land seems to be the root cause of the triple murder, but we are also probing it from other angles. It appears that the murder was pre-planned. Bhanu's wife Aarti, who saved her life by hiding in the room, informed the police about the matter. We will soon arrest the three killer brothers.”
        
        The deceased Rajendra Singh lived in Mathura with his younger son Hem Prakash, while he owned 2.5 bighas of land and a two-room house in Garhi Kalia, where his other sons were living.
        
        Rajendra Singh had divided the village land equally among all his sons. But the accused Jayaprakash, Bhanupratap, and Harveer objected to his decision.
        
        On Monday, Rajendra Singh came to the village from Mathura to talk to his sons about the land distribution. On Tuesday, at around 10 am, he arranged for a family meeting to resolve the matter. When he refused to accede to the demands of his three sons, they attacked and killed him along with his two other sons.</p></div>
